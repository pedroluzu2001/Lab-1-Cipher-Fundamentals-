# Lab-1 Cipher Fundamental
This lab introduces fundamental principles of cryptography, covering key concepts such as Base-64, hexadecimal, basic operators (AND, OR, X-OR), the modulus operator, bit rotation (Rotate Right and Rotate Left), and prime numbers. It also includes puzzle-solving exercises to develop cipher-cracking skills. 

A Introduction 
Prime Numbers Definition
